> **Winner Project** - *Intelligent code fixing system that resurrects broken Python code using multi-agent AI collaboration*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Phoenix** is a revolutionary AI-powered code fixing system that automatically identifies, analyzes, and repairs Python code errors using advanced multi-agent technology. Like the mythical phoenix rising from ashes, this system breathes new life into broken code, transforming errors into elegant, working solutions.

### 🎯 Key Innovation

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Two specialized AI agents (Fixer + Verifier) work collaboratively
- **Real-Time Code Execution**: Uses CodeInterpreterTool for live testing and validation
- **Intelligent Error Analysis**: Advanced error detection with contextual understanding
- **Beautiful Dark Theme UI**: Stunning glassmorphism design optimized for developers
- **Instant Results**: Lazy loading and optimized performance for rapid iteration

---

## ✨ Features

### 🤖 **Dual-Agent System**
- **🔧 Fixer Agent**: Analyzes and repairs code systematically
- **✅ Verifier Agent**: Reviews and optimizes for best practices

### 🎨 **Premium User Experience**
- **Dark Theme**: Eye-friendly interface with stunning visual effects
- **Real-time Progress**: Live feedback during code analysis
- **Copy-to-Clipboard**: Instant code copying functionality
- **Download Results**: Export fixed code as files

### 🧠 **Advanced AI Capabilities**
- **Context-Aware Fixing**: Understands code intent and expected behavior
- **Multi-Iteration Repair**: Persistent fixing until code works perfectly
- **Best Practices Integration**: Ensures clean, Pythonic code output
- **Error Pattern Recognition**: Learns from common coding mistakes

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Frontend** | Streamlit | Interactive web interface |
| **AI Framework** | CrewAI | Multi-agent orchestration |
| **LLM** | Google Gemini 1.5 Flash | Natural language processing |
| **Code Execution** | CodeInterpreterTool | Live code testing |
| **Package Manager** | UV | Fast dependency management |
| **Styling** | Custom CSS | Glassmorphism dark theme |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10-3.13
- Google Gemini API Key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd phoenix
```

2. **Install UV package manager**
```bash
pip install uv
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
uv sync
```

4. **Configure environment**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your Google Gemini API key to .env file
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" >> .env
```

5. **Launch Phoenix**
```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

6. **Open your browser**
Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` and start fixing code!

---

## 💡 How It Works

### 1. **Code Submission**
Users paste problematic Python code into the elegant interface

### 2. **Intelligent Analysis**
The Fixer Agent analyzes the code using:
- Syntax error detection
- Logic flow analysis  
- Runtime error prediction
- Context understanding

### 3. **Collaborative Fixing**
- **Fixer Agent** repairs identified issues
- **Verifier Agent** reviews and optimizes the solution
- Both agents use CodeInterpreterTool for live testing

### 4. **Verified Solution**
Users receive working, optimized Python code with explanations

## 🎮 Usage Example

**Input** (Broken Code):
```python
def calculate_average(numbers)
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)

print(calculate_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

**Phoenix Output** (Fixed Code):
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)

print(calculate_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
```

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added missing colon in function definition
- Added missing closing parenthesis in print statement
- Added empty list validation for robustness

## 🔧 Configuration

### Agent Customization
Modify `src/phoenix/config/agents.yaml` to customize agent behavior:

```yaml
fixer_agent:
  role: "Code Fixer"
  goal: "Fix Python code errors systematically"
  backstory: "Expert debugger with pattern recognition"

verifier_agent:
  role: "Code Verifier" 
  goal: "Ensure code quality and best practices"
  backstory: "Senior code reviewer focused on optimization"
```

### Task Configuration
Update `src/phoenix/config/tasks.yaml` for custom workflows:

```yaml
fix_task:
  description: "Analyze and fix the provided Python code"
  expected_output: "Working Python code with explanations"

verify_task:
  description: "Review and optimize the fixed code"
  expected_output: "Verified, production-ready code"
```
